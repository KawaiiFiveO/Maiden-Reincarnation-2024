			<p class="pf">It was a thoughtful room, and tobacco smoke clung round the edges of the lamp. The two men who sat there were thoughtful, but that was not the only point of similarity between them. They had the same worried look of persons too much interested in other men’s affairs. Sir John Landervorne had once come from that vague section of London known as Whitehall, and he had been possibly the only man in the city who might have given police orders to Scotland Yard. If M. Henri Bencolin was only one of France’s eighty-six prefects of police, he was not the least important of them.</p>
			<p class="p">Fog had made London medieval again, a place of towers and footsteps and dim figures. It blurred the windows of the room in Fontain Court, the backwater of Fleet Street where the barristers sometimes walk in their ghostly wigs, swinging canes like swords. In the room the two men, sitting opposite each other with white shirt fronts bulging exactly alike, smoked similar cigars&mdash;Bencolin with his black beard, Landervorne’s beard gray as the cigar ash. It gave one a weird feeling: picture of a detective at thirty, then a picture of him at sixty. Their eyes were somber.</p>
			<p class="p">“If you tell me your story,” said Sir John, “you will have to tell it to Billy Garrick, because these are his rooms, and he will be in presently. But it will be safe; he was there last night too.”</p>
			<p class="p">Bencolin nodded. He spoke rather wearily.</p>
			<p class="p">“I know it, my friend. Of course, I did not telephone you officially&mdash;I am not connected officially with the matter. Well! Last night near Worksop, in Nottinghamshire, M. Jules Fragneau was murdered. That is why I wanted to see you.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Then,” said the Englishman, “I shall have to tell you a story which will not interest you, unless you believe in sorcery. Because, you see, the only man who might have killed Fragneau walked through a pair of locked shutters at ten o’clock last night.”</p>
			<p class="p">“The report is true, then. Oh, the devil!” Bencolin fretted.</p>
			<p class="p">“The report is fantastic, and true. I saw Cyril Merton go into a room that had only one door, which was bolted and which I was watching. The room had only one window, barred, with locked shutters. There was no fireplace, nor was there any secret means of egress; the walls were stone. Exactly that. It was a stone box. But I tell you Merton went into the place&mdash;and vanished. Lord Brandon and Garrick, who were with me when we searched it both before and after the disappearance, will verify what I say. Afterwards an even stranger thing occurred. For surely Merton killed Fragneau, and then he very nearly committed another murder, at which time I saw him evaporate before my eyes. That, my dear sir, is witchcraft, and,” he added thoughtfully, “I am a sane man. At least, I think I am a sane man.”</p>
			<p class="p">M. Bencolin got up. Fog had crept in and mingled with the tobacco smoke; the Frenchman shivered. He looked small and shrunken, and very tired. With the cigar protruding ludicrously from his mouth, he began to wander about the room.</p>
			<p class="p">“My friend, I am beaten. Name of God!” he said fiercely. “I am beaten! I thought that I had enough impossible riddles in my case. But unless we can prove he made a phantom of himself a third time, and got into a locked house, a poor stupid fellow named Fulke will be indicted for murder. Of course these events are connected! Tell me the whole story, please.”</p>
			<p class="p">Sir John sat back in his chair. His face was pinched with thought.</p>
			<p class="p">“Very well. There’s a preface, you see, about Cyril Merton. Give Merton a wig and a sword, and he would be your seventeenth-century swashbuckler&mdash;but you must grant him a wig. For though he was tall, and rather strangely handsome with a thin luminous face in which you saw every emotion as through glass, the man’s head was shaven. He had studied in Germany before he became an actor, and his ugly nature got him into duels with the saber, which left scars on his head. The scars were so hideous that hair only made them worse. So he kept his head shaven, criss-crossed white. But the beauty of his face, with the short dark beard, kept him from being ridiculous.</p>
			<p class="p">“He was our greatest actor. If you saw him in any of the old romantic plays you know the medieval soul of the man. He could turn himself into any sort of character; that was his genius. The man’s hobby was sorcery and the deadly arts, in pursuit of which he had a library stuffed with forgotten books&mdash;the works of Hermes the Egyptian, Lillius, Geber, James Stuart, Cotton Mather, all of them. He belonged in a day when they burned such men.</p>
			<p class="p">“That was why he bought the place. Bell House is on a tract of ground that was once a part of Sherwood Forest, about thirty miles from where Fragneau lived. Bell House! You can see the tower of the bell lifted over the trees, with a hill of silver birches white in the moonlight, and the wind moving them. It was built when William the Norman darkened England with a hurricane of swords, and there are clanking ghosts in its halls. That was a dirty, snarling age&mdash;church and the devil frightening the soul out of people, big men in armor, faces caked with blood, butchering in nameless filth&mdash;the very bogey house of history. Why, the moat around Bell House is twenty feet deep.</p>
			<p class="p">“I have to tell you about a dinner Cyril Merton gave. There was the banquet hall, with pointed windows of painted glass, and the candles shining on them; I remember the white shirt fronts, the cigar smoke, the flashing teeth when people laughed. One gets a series of impressions in a shadowy place like that. For example, I remember the picture of Billy Garrick with Madeline&mdash;maybe because Madeline is my daughter&mdash;on the staircase after dinner; on the staircase under the dark portraits, and the candles. They are both yellow-haired, handsome as old Saxons. It was an absurd gesture on his part, but the place for it: he kissed her hand.</p>
			<p class="p">“They are in love, and I have an especial interest in Garrick for that reason. I was worried about him that evening. Billy is a nephew of Jules Fragneau. Because the old man had been rather more than his father, and made him his heir, Fragneau’s enemies were Billy’s enemies. Which was the reason why Merton, who hated Fragneau almost to the point of idiocy, never got along with the lad. He had been forced to invite him because Billy was my guest, and I was too close a neighbor to be omitted. For the same reason Billy had been forced to accept. All through the evening I felt uneasy.</p>
			<p class="p">“It all culminated in a foolish argument in the smoking room. The men had assembled there by a big blazing fireplace, with stags’ heads, and all that. Having just come away from Madeline, Billy was in an exultant, swaggering mood. He smoked cigarettes and laughed at Merton, who was holding forth on his hobby of medieval magic against Lord Brandon and Mr. Julian Arbor. He was standing against the mantelpiece, black beard, shaven head, using that smile with which he argues.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘I was telling you,’ said Merton, ‘about the book of Gersault de Brilliers, published by Meroit, Paris, in 1697: “Contes du Diable,” with a subhead: “Avec L’Histoire de L’Homme Qui Savait S’Evanouir.” One of the accounts deals with a man who walked into a locked room and vanished utterly. De Brilliers put it down to sorcery, which is possible. But a perfectly practicable kind of sorcery.’</p>
			<p class="p">“Mr. Julian Arbor protested. Arbor is a strange sort of English gentleman; doesn’t at all object to helping out people who are financially in a hole&mdash;at tremendous interest. Just a polished form of moneylender. The man looks kindly, but he has a hard glaze on him like a tombstone. He protested gently: ‘My dear fellow&mdash;’</p>
			<p class="p">“‘Bosh!’ struck in Billy Garrick. ‘Bosh, Merton!’</p>
			<p class="p">“It was a typical gathering, with a mass of stuffy landed proprietors who always have the look of just having eaten too much. Bald and florid and oratorical as the elder Pitt. Lord Brandon is one of these.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘This, sir,’ observed Lord Brandon, ‘strikes me as being a great deal of foolishness.’ He waddled to the fire, waving his hands.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘Nevertheless, it happened,’ the actor replied. ‘It can happen again.’</p>
			<p class="p">“Billy was just a bit drunk. He protested furiously:</p>
			<p class="p">“‘Look here, Merton, you’re usually so aloof that nobody contradicts you. And this grand superiority complex of yours is making me tired! If you can stand there and talk solemn stuff like that&mdash;’</p>
			<p class="p">“‘It can be done,’ said Merton quietly. ‘I can do it myself.’</p>
			<p class="p">“He was always one to play to an audience, and he enjoyed the consternation he created among that group of squires, smiling at his cigar.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘You mean, Merton, that you can walk into a locked room&mdash;a real locked room&mdash;and disappear?’ asked Julian Arbor.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘Trap doors!’ snapped Billy instantly.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘There are no trap doors. I say that I can go into a stone room here at the castle, have you lock doors and windows, and I can vanish. Just that.’</p>
			<p class="p">“‘Bosh!’ repeated Billy.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘See here,’ said Merton, ‘if you want my opinion, even a host’s opinion, your talk is damned impertinence.’</p>
			<p class="p">“‘And if you want mine,’ said Billy, ‘yours is damned non-sense.’</p>
			<p class="p">“Merton was furious; the glass face lit like fire.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘We’ll drop your gutter behavior for the present; it can be argued later. Garrick, do you want to wager me a thousand pounds that I can’t do what I say, eh?’</p>
			<p class="p">“‘Oh, I say!’ cried Julian Arbor. ‘Don’t be a fool!’ He turned to Billy in alarm. ‘Surely you won’t&mdash;Merton, I refuse to allow&mdash;’</p>
			<p class="p">“‘What have you got to do with it?’ demanded Billy, who was angry too. ‘Keep out of this, sir! Merton, I shall be glad to see you make an ass of yourself. I accept your wager.’</p>
			<p class="p">“‘If Mr. Merton will allow me, I accept it too,’ Lord Brandon interposed.</p>
			<p class="p">“Merton laughed.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘Are there any other takers, gentlemen?’ he said casually.”</p>
			<p class="p">Sir John paused. Bencolin had sat down, and was staring at him. The Englishman lighted another cigar before he resumed.</p>
			<p class="p">“Well, the thing was fantastic, but it was done. Only Mr. Julian Arbor would not remain to see the wager carried out. He said he had to catch a night train for London, departing with somewhat jarring abruptness&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">“For <span class="i">London</span>?” demanded Bencolin. “London? Pardon me; go on.”</p>
			<p class="p">The words had been rather like a yelp. Sir John smiled.</p>
			<p class="p">“I was surprised, I must confess, but there were other matters on my mind. Merton was carrying off the affair with theatrical grace. We had to tell the ladies, who suspected some sort of joke, but insisted on following us. And yet the big halls, the weird unnaturalness of the place, got their nerves on edge; Madeline enjoyed it. The others began a shrill rush of talk, which gradually slowed and stopped like a run-down gramophone. Anything was better than the unnatural sound of those voices.</p>
			<p class="p">“Merton took us upstairs. We were a solemn company, parading the halls with candles. That castle was too big for us, and the moon was too far&mdash;it followed us along every hall, peering through the windows. Once Merton paused by a window, the silhouette of him with the moon behind his head; his face jumped suddenly out of the dark as he lighted a cigarette by the candleflame, and then it vanished. The silhouette contorted as though the man were dancing.</p>
			<p class="p">“He led us to an immense room, quite bare, so that you could see only the aimless candles moving under people’s faces. At its far end was a door, which Merton threw open. It communicated with a flight of steps, walled with stone and having at the top another door. On the threshold Merton paused, with a kind of bluish glow behind him.</p>
			<p class="p">“‘This,’ he said, ‘is the room itself. I should prefer that the ladies did not enter. Come along, Lord Brandon, Sir John, Garrick too&mdash;examine it. I shall go in here. You will bolt the door at the bottom of the steps on the outside, and watch it. First go over this staircase to be sure there is no other exit.’</p>
			<p class="p">“Somebody laughed a bit nervously. Merton finished his cigarette while we moved around the flight of steps. Then&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">“Wait!” Bencolin interrupted. “Please don’t describe it; don’t describe the room. I am going to see it, and I want to form my own impressions. It might lead me astray if I heard too many details. But one thing: was there a washstand in the place?”</p>
			<p class="p">Sir John’s heavy eyes flashed open.</p>
			<p class="p">“Yes! Why do you ask? That washstand was a curious thing to see there…”</p>
			<p class="p">“Go on, my friend.”</p>
			<p class="p">“We will say, then, that the room was large and odd. Garrick, Lord Brandon and I went over every foot of it. Intact! A window in a big stone embrasure was firmly barred. We closed and locked the shutters. Then we pronounced ourselves satisfied, Lord Brandon red and puzzled. As we were going out, Merton stopped us. He stood by the table in the light of a lamp of blue glass, but only his absolutely pallid hand protruded from the shadow, toying with a little ebony figure of… a goat. Garrick, as tall and threatening as he, said: ‘Anything more?’</p>
			<p class="p">“‘Lord Brandon,’ Merton answered, ignoring him, ‘I am doing a dangerous thing. If I make a mistake, if you have any cause to think that such is the case, at the end of fifteen minutes come up here instantly! You promise me that?’</p>
			<p class="p">“Brandon promised&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">“One moment,” said the Frenchman. “Did you look in all the table drawers?”</p>
			<p class="p">“My dear fellow,” Sir John returned petulantly, “a man can’t hide in a table drawer, or escape through it.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Of course not. Well?”</p>
			<p class="p">“The last thing I remember was Merton standing by the table, playing with the tiny goat’s figure. It was as though he were deliberately trying to call our attention to that image.”</p>
			<p class="p">“He was. He may have been trying to give you a clue.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Oh, come! What do you mean by that?”</p>
			<p class="p">“I don’t know; it merely struck me as curious. You went downstairs?”</p>
			<p class="p">“We went downstairs, yes. I bolted the lower door on the outside. Then it began. We found that we had left all but two of the candles in Merton’s room. There we were, a blundering, half-frightened crowd in a gulf of a place, candles tossing. Nervous laughter, figures moving about us. I had one of the lights, and kept it on my watch. Fifteen minutes&mdash;dragging. And women talking, and talking. But I never lost sight of the door, nor did Lord Brandon, who was standing in front of it. Somewhere in the house I thought I heard hurrying footsteps, and once the sound of water running. Finally there occurred the thing that broke our nerves like somebody jumping on you in the dark.</p>
			<p class="p">“It was an explosion, the terrific noise a pistol makes when it is fired indoors. Brandon and his following would have rushed the door even had not somebody shouted, ‘Time’s up!’ The cry ripped into a screech of the bolt and a rush of feet up the stairs, but I remained in the background to make sure nobody slipped past those who entered. Nobody did! I went up slowly, examining the stairs, and joined the group at the door when I was certain of it&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">Suddenly Sir John crashed his fist down on the chair arm.</p>
			<p class="p">“Merton was gone! No one left the top door; the others stood guard while Brandon, Garrick and I searched the whole apartment. We were in a kind of frenzy. Shutters fastened, bars untouched; as a matter of fact, there was dust on the bars. No Merton, no hidden door. Some sort of weapon had been fired there, for a faint tang of powder was in the air, but we found no weapon. The blue glass lamp burned dully, fixing our eyes like a crucible, and a bit of smoke hovered over it like waving hands… But in spite of it all, I know that before we came nobody had either entered or left that door!”</p>
			<p class="red"><span class="i">And, as later events proved, Sir John spoke the absolute truth.</span></p>

			<p class="pf">Lamplight had made the thickening smoke in the room a yellow haze. Both Bencolin and Sir John Landervorne looked weirdly unnatural. Bencolin said:</p>
			<p class="p">“That statement, my friend, would be ridiculed in a court of law. We can prove nothing on the man now&mdash;don’t you see? Under the circumstances of Fragneau’s death, either the man Fulke or myself, the only other occupants of his house, must have killed him. Fragneau was stabbed about twelve o’clock last night. Merton disappeared at ten, easily in time for him to have gone thirty miles by motor. There is nothing more inconspicuous than the driver of an automobile at night. Now, then, at twelve-fifteen, or thereabouts, I telephoned you at your home, because I knew that you lived close to Merton. It was no burglar’s work, because nothing had been stolen at Fragneau’s home; the only person who might have killed Fragneau was Merton, and I wanted to check up on his whereabouts instantly. There would be no possibility of his servants lying as to his movements if I communicated with <span class="i">you</span>. Your butler told me that you were at Merton’s, and had not returned. I left a message for you to call&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">“At twelve-fifteen,” interrupted the Englishman, “Madeline, Garrick and I were returning to my home. In that interval Merton had not appeared. The question being: if he was perpetrating a joke, why did he not return? We waited two hours before we reassured the servants and left. But in the vicinity of one-thirty, Merton <span class="i">did</span> come back. We will connect that up with the story later. Tell me about Fragneau.”</p>
			<p class="p">“The very devilish simplicity of it, my friend, is that I have no story. You know Fragneau. His hobby was astronomy; I will not say astrology, because it was there that the Merton-Fragneau feud began. Every time I have visited his house he has shown me some new device to keep out burglars. He had a big glass dome of an observatory on the roof, an open place, so that in this fanatical fear of intruders there was an iron fence, ten feet high and electrically charged, around the entire roof. The house being small, every window had its own protective fastening. On each of the two doors was a lock for which no duplicate key could be made! Imagine it&mdash;the place was a fortress. Fulke, a big, awkward, red-haired fellow, was his new servant. I remember his wooden face at the door when I arrived, hair tilted over its side like a vivid wig&mdash;and the white-lit dome uncanny up against the night sky, with Fragneau’s shadow flickering over it.</p>
			<p class="p">“Facts, these. At eleven o’clock Fragneau went over the place, adjusted all his devices, locked his doors. We had been talking, but he insisted on working in his laboratory as a nightly ritual. I was not interested, and went to my room to read. It overlooked the front stairs. At twelve I grew tired of reading, at which time I started for the observatory to bring him down for a final cigar…</p>
			<p class="p">“Fragneau sat before the telescope with a stupid grin on his face. His chest was heavy with blood where he had been stabbed with a bone-handled knife a very few minutes before. The glare of light, the white-pointed face like a goat’s, the yellow shaft protruding from his chest, all calm as sleep.</p>
			<p class="p">“I summoned Fulke; the house was searched, the doors and windows found locked. Neither of us had heard an intruder. We calmly went about questioning each other; then I put in two telephone messages, to you and to the local police. That is all, except for one point. At twelve-thirty a man rang the doorbell and asked to see Fragneau… Once,” added the Frenchman abruptly, “when I learned that Fulke was a new servant, I conceived a theory as to the assassination. Now it is all dark, considering what you say, unless…” He paused, and smiled.</p>
			<p class="p">“Unless what?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Unless, in a manner of speaking, Cyril Merton washed himself down the drain. To give you more than an indication&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">“Bencolin,” demanded the Englishman, “are you insane? Great God!”</p>
			<p class="p">“Wait! Please wait! You would be insulted if I continued. My friend, I think the motive in this affair is money. Do you know who rang the doorbell half an hour after the murder? It was Mr. Julian Arbor.”</p>

			<h1 class="cn" id="calibre_link-92"><a id="calibre_link-30"></a>III</h1>
			<p class="pf">A gust of colder air blew in from the foggy corridor as the door opened. Bencolin was still straining forward, elbow on the table, the fingers of his hand crooked toward Sir John. And as a third figure, lean and tall in its greatcoat, came toward them, they had the appearance of people in a storm. The newcomer took off his hat, displaying eyes of a rather brilliant vivid blue in a face glistening like wax. The eyes struck Bencolin with the suddenness of rifle shots; they had a wretched, terrible appeal.</p>
			<p class="p">“Hello, Sir John,” he said hoarsely, croaking with a cold. “This the M. Bencolin you came to see? My name’s Garrick, sir. Well, every dragnet in England is out for that damned murdering&mdash;Start a fire, will you?”</p>
			<p class="p">He sat down, shivering, and threw off his coat. His arm was in a sling.</p>
			<p class="p">“I&mdash;I just left Madeline. She was crying…”</p>
			<p class="p">There was an odd strained silence. Then Sir John got up blunderingly and began to heap wood in the fireplace.</p>
			<p class="p">“He didn’t suffer,” said Bencolin. “I mean…”</p>
			<p class="p">“I am glad to hear it,” replied the young man. They did not see his face.</p>
			<p class="p">“My friend,” the Frenchman began, “God willing, we will find Merton.”</p>
			<p class="p">He paused, but the words had something like the ring of an oath. Then he looked at Garrick’s arm. “The second victim! When did he attack?”</p>
			<p class="p">“It was about one-thirty. Sir, the thing is too incredible! Are you sure Merton is a <span class="i">man</span>?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Steady!” warned Sir John.</p>
			<p class="p">“Well… I had gone to bed. It was bright moonlight in the room, hard and clear as glass. I was fuming about Merton, just drifting to sleep, when I heard someone cry out.”</p>
			<p class="p">Sir John paused with a lighted match in his hand.</p>
			<p class="p">“I was at one window across the quadrangle,” he interposed. “My room. I could not sleep. Then I saw a shadow move. The moon shone on a head that was perfectly white. Something began climbing the ivy toward a window on the second floor, and when I realized whose window, I knew who that person was. I could not help screaming to warn Garrick&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">“It saved my life,” the other said calmly. “When I sat up in bed, a silhouette reared up over the windowsill, but I saw the white head. And then,” he rushed on, “it came at a kind of bound, like a goat. The light from the open window was blocked as it got me; I felt the tangle of the bedclothes, the rip into my arm of a pain, blinding and sickish like ether. My arm began to grow hot, but I fought him. Somehow he tore away&mdash;Sir John, are you <span class="i">sure</span> nobody left by the door?”</p>
			<p class="p">“I would swear to it. Listen, Bencolin, for your final riddle. After I cried out, I ran out of my room. In the central hallway I met Dorset, the butler who took your message. I didn’t explain, but I told him to hurry outside and stop anybody who came out by a window. Don’t you see? If we were in time, we had Merton trapped! Doors were banging open in the house, lights flashing on. When I reached Garrick’s door the lights in the corridor were blazing. Behind the door was the furious wheezing and thudding of a fight; a chair clattered over; somebody began to run. The door was bolted, but it was flimsy wood. I battered it until the bolt ripped out. Billy almost ran into me&mdash;and before him there was a shadow. I switched on the lights, standing in the door, and for one instant the picture was hideous and sharp and motionless as waxworks. Billy, full white on the square of gray moonlight, with a sheet trailing him, his arm running red as though it were alive. The intruder was gone! We hunted the room over, after which I called to Dorset. He answered that nobody had left by the window.”</p>
			<p class="p">“He was going for the door!” Garrick cried excitedly. “Then you opened it in my face. And yet I touched him a moment before!”</p>
			<p class="p">Bencolin sat with his head between his hands; Sir John was standing by the fireplace without moving, and held the charred curl of a match. Fog had seeped into the room until the lamplight was all but obscured.</p>

			<p class="pf">Bencolin had not slept for twenty-four hours. If the man who had listened to the amazing recitals of Sir John Landervorne and Billy Garrick the night before had been neat, correct as a picture, then it was somewhat of an apparition which went stamping about Bell House the next day. Unshaven, with a battered hat stuck on his head like a helmet, the man resembled a conception of an early Goth. He had been seen early in the morning standing against a red tattered sky among the mists at the edge of the moat, and he was poking in the water with a walking stick.</p>
			<p class="p">This was no England of the sort called merrie, of Robin Hood and warm leaves and gray goose feather. It was stern as the Norman. And the work which presently occupied the constables under Bencolin’s direction was sterner still. Through the November morning they were wading in the moat.</p>
			<p class="p">When, after a while, he entered the big silent house, there were only a few servants for him to question. Their employer had not returned, and yet they were fearful to leave. While he explored every dusty corner, he could hear the solemn tramp of feet. Finally he went upstairs to the tower room. It was there, in the afternoon, that those he had summoned found him.</p>
			<p class="p">The afternoon sun, an ugly rose color, shot across the room like a spotlight from the window embrasure. It rested on the closed door of a closet, which Bencolin had earlier in the day explored and found empty. In the middle of the apartment stood the table with its tiny goat’s statue, so that the sun outlined on the closet door a monstrous figure of a goat. When Sir John Landervorne opened the door to the room, he saw only that shaft of light in shadows, beyond which was the glow of Bencolin’s eternal cigar. The Englishman shuddered, fumbling at his beard.</p>
			<p class="p">“That you, Bencolin?” he asked. “Ugh! What a place! Shall we come in?”</p>
			<p class="p">“I see no reason,” protested a voice behind him, “for dragging us up here from London! I told you everything you wanted to know last night.” It was Julian Arbor, who pushed past Sir John; though he seemed angry, not a muscle in his big white face moved.</p>
			<p class="p">“The matter is serious,” Bencolin responded. “Will the rest of you come in? Lord Brandon? Thank you. And Mr. Garrick. Who’s that?” His nerves were jumpy, and he leaned suddenly out into the light at the sound of another voice.</p>
			<p class="p">“Madeline insisted&mdash;” said Sir John.</p>
			<p class="p">“I did!” a little voice confirmed him, laughing. The girl looked light as though she might be blown by a wind, with a sort of half beauty in her face that was rather better than loveliness. White-clad, she moved forward. “Mayn’t I stay? You’ve promised us a solution, and I want to hear it.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Sir John, this is impossible!” the Frenchman snapped.</p>
			<p class="p">“I won’t go,” said the girl. “I have as much right to be here as anyone.”</p>
			<p class="p">Bencolin stared at her; at the sight of his face a movement went through the watchers. They knew why. In that room was terror.</p>
			<p class="p">“Merton is here!” said Bencolin.</p>
			<p class="p">That was it&mdash;terror. Sir John began thickly, nervously:</p>
			<p class="p">“Go out, Madeline; please go out. My God, what are you saying?”</p>
			<p class="p">“He is here,” went on the Frenchman, “he is in this room. Lord Brandon, stand in front of that door. The rest of you sit down, and whatever happens, do not move.”</p>
			<p class="p">In the half darkness somebody stumbled a little. Bencolin had stepped in front of the window. Against the reddish light they saw his profile with the high hooked nose and bearded jaw. The energy had gone out of him; his shoulders were stooped, and he stared out thoughtfully into the sky.</p>
			<p class="p">“It’s an odd case,” he said. “It’s the only case on record in which a man proves an alibi for his murderer. And it shows many curious things. For example, there is that appearance of Mr. Julian Arbor at Fragneau’s house after the murder&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">“Look here,” snapped Arbor, and he came into the light with his big white face intent. “I told you I was there, I admitted it. But what does that mean? It doesn’t show that I killed Fragneau, if that’s what you think! It doesn’t show that I had any criminal intent&mdash;”</p>
			<p class="p">“Of course not,” said the Frenchman, “but what does it show? I mean, you have been telling me what it doesn’t show; now I ask you what it does show.” He did not turn from the window, but he went on rapidly: “And what does the white head of this midnight prowler show?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Why, that it was Merton.” Sir John stared at him oddly.</p>
			<p class="p">“You are wrong. The white head shows that it was <span class="i">not</span> Merton.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Then you say,” Sir John cried, “that Merton did not stab Garrick?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Not at all. Merton did stab Garrick.”</p>
			<p class="p">“Well, why didn’t Merton come in the window, then?”</p>
			<p class="p">“Because he was dead,” said Bencolin quietly.</p>
			<p class="p">There was a sudden silence like the stroke of a gong. They all looked at Bencolin as though he had gone mad and were gabbling calm nonsense.</p>
			<p class="p">“You will find Merton’s body in the closet behind you, Sir John,” continued the Frenchman. He turned full about, and he did not raise his voice when he spoke again, but it had a horrible sound of finality:</p>
			<p class="p">“Open the closet, Garrick. One of your victims is inside.”</p>
